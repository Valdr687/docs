As a women [CEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYfYPyjaN3w) never said "We say that women are paid less, that's not true, I earn as much as a men. As I hired women, I saved money on their salaries. That allowed me to increase mine".

Comme ne l'a jamais dit une [PDG](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYfYPyjaN3w) "On dit que les femmes gagnent moins, c'est faux, je gagne autant qu'un homme. Comme j'ai embauché des femmes, j'ai fait des économies sur leurs salaires. Ca m'a permis d'augmenter le mien".

### Concepts

* A new world order : Un nouvel ordre mondial
* Inequality (plural: inequalities): Inégalité
* Social classes : Classes sociales

## Cultural references

### Inequalities

* **Oxfam**
Confederation of ONGs known for its reports on poverty and wealth distribution. Its 2025 report states most billionaire wealth is taken, not earned - with 60% coming from either inheritance, cronyism or monopoly power. Furthermore, our deeply unequal world remains colonial in many ways. There is a long history of colonial domination which has largely benefited the richest people. This system still extracts wealth from the Global South to the super-rich 1% in the Global North at a rate of $30million an hour.[^1]

* **Queerbaiting**
Marketing technique for fiction and entertainment in which creators hint at, but do not depict, same-sex romance or other LGBTQ+ representation.[^2]

### Social classes

* **Social class**
A social class or social stratum is a grouping of people into a set of hierarchical social categories, the most common being the working class, middle class, and upper class. Membership of a social class can for example be dependent on education, wealth, occupation, income, and belonging to a particular subculture or social network

* **Class defector**  
A class defector is an individual who has experienced a change in social background during his life, a famous exemple is the Nobel prize Annie Ernaux. Those individuals might seem to be counter-exemples to the theory of social reproduction but that idea is challenged by Laélia Véron and Karine Abiven in *Betrayal and revenge* as this narrative

### A new world order

* **Project 2025**
Project 2025 is a political initiative to reshape the federal government of the United States and consolidate executive power in favor of right-wing policies.

* **"Adolf Hitler [...] was a communist socialist guy"** [^3]
For over an hour on January 9 during a LiveStream on X, the AfD chancellery candidate spoke live to Elon Musk, evoking a 'communist' Hitler and the 'huge side effects' of vaccines. For context the AfD (Alternative for Deutschland) is a far(-far)-right party in Germany who received 20% of votes in 2025.

* **AP and "Gulf of America"**
A journalist from Associated Press (l'équivalent de l'AFP) was barred from entering the Oval Office because AP refused to use the term "Gulf of America" to refer to the Gulf of Mexico.

* **SignalGate**
Top administration officials were using a Signal group chat to discuss American strikes of an impending strike in Yemen without noticing that they added a journalist from the *Atlantic*. The journalist published screenshots of the conversation, where JD Vance and others were discussing classified information. JD Vance said he hated to help Europeans again.

* **DOGE**
Department supposed to "modernize federal technology and software to maximize governmental efficiency" ruled by Elon Musk meant to save a billion. *Wired*, ***The*** newspaper of Silicon Valley, said "The Incompetence of DOGE Is a Feature, Not a Bug" as they track the damages done by the department who earned access to all internal governmental data, the way they cut spending has been accused of being against the Constitution (Congress is the one suppose to manage the budget).
