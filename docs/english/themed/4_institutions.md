The leader of AfD co-hosted a live stream with Elon Musk, and they came to the conclusion that "Hitler was a socialist, a communist" among others[^5].

* **The project 2025**  
It is a 900-page policy "wish list", a set of proposals that would expand presidential power and impose an ultra-conservative social vision. Disavowed by Trump during his campaign, he nominated a lot of people who were part of the project. [Read this article](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c977njnvq2do)
