### Fake news

* **Dreyfus affair**  
The Dreyfus affair was a political scandal that involved the wrongful conviction for treason of Captain Alfred Dreyfus, a young French artillery officer of Alsatian Jewish descent. When the affair leaked to the press, most of the French press labeled Dreyfus as guilty without evidence and despite the fact he had yet to be judged. (*Not that the trial wasn't a already decided, but Presumption of innocence is a thing too*)

* **Echo chamber**  
An echo chamber is a metaphorical description of a situation in which beliefs are amplified or reinforced by communication and repetition inside a closed system. It is often used to describe the situation of media, social media or even political parties where only one side of the story is told and the other is ignored or even censored, the term was first used in 2006 by Cass Sunstein.

* **Boris Johnson and chest size** (you've read that right)  
"Voting Tory will cause your wife to have bigger breasts and increase your chances of owning a BMW M3." (Actual quote [^1])  
The Brexit will save the UK (*spoiler alert*, it did not)

### Conspiracy theories

* **PizzaGate**
Hillary Clinton and its campaign director John Podesta were said to be at the head of a pedophile network based in a Washington pizzeria. The theory almost led to a very real drama, when an armed man burst into the pizzeria to "release the children".[^2]

* **QAnon**  
QAnon is the umbrella term for a set of internet conspiracy theories that allege, falsely, that the world is run by a cabal of Satan-worshiping pedophiles.  
QAnon followers believe that this cabal includes top Democrats like Biden Jr., Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, as well as a number of entertainers and Hollywood celebrities like Oprah Winfrey, Tom Hanks and Ellen DeGeneres and religious figures including Pope Francis and the Dalai Lama. Many of them also believe that, in addition to molesting children, members of this group kill and eat their victims to extract a life-extending chemical called adrenochrome.[^3]

### Press

* **Jamal Khashoggi**  
Washington Post journalist, a Saudi Arabian dissident – He wrote a column in the Washington Post in which he criticized the policies of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (aka MBS) and was assassinated in October 2018 in Istanbul

* **Cambridge Analytica Scandal**  
In the 2010s, personal data belonging to millions of Facebook users was collected without their consent by British consulting firm Cambridge Analytica, predominantly to be used for political advertising. This resulted in peoples being targeted during Donald Trump election and the Brexit.
