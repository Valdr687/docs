# Documentation

The repository contains various educational resources that I have created or compiled over time. You will find revision sheets, practical guides, and other useful documents covering various subjects. Some of these sheets are intended for PT/PTSI students, others for Centrale Lille students, while others are transversal.

This content is best browsed on the [website](https://vervada.me/docs).
